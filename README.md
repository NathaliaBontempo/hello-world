A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master. When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
